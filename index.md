## Research Focus
My research centers on high-fidelity **computational fluid dynamics (CFD)** for aerospace, mechanical, and wind/renewable energy systems. I specialize in CFD with turbulence modeling, moving-geometry simulations (sliding and overset meshes), and aerodynamic analysis of unconventional wind turbines using **OpenFOAM** and high-performance computing workflows. My goal is to bridge component-level CFD with system-level energy and sustainability applications.
