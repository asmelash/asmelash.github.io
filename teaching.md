# Teaching & Academic Interests

I am interested in teaching and mentoring in the following areas:

- Fluid Mechanics
- Computational Fluid Dynamics
- Turbulence and Applied Aerodynamics
- Renewable Energy Systems
- Energy–Environment–Society interfaces

I emphasize concept-first teaching supported by computational and physical intuition.
